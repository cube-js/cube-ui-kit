Added `Tabs` component for organizing content into multiple panels with full accessibility support via React Aria. The component supports multiple visual styles (default, panel, radio), tab deletion, inline title editing, lazy rendering with content caching, and proper integration with Layout components for stretching panels to fill remaining space.
