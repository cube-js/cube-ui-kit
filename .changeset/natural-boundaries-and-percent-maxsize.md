Added support for CSS string values (like percentages) for `maxSize` prop in Layout.Panel, added `minContentSize` prop to Layout component to control minimum content area between panels, and implemented natural boundaries logic so panels on opposite sides automatically prevent overlap and maintain minimum content space.
