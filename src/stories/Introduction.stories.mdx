# Welcome to Storybook of Cube Cloud UI Kit

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `src/stories` directory to learn how they work.

## Core Concepts

UI Kit is designed using atomic approach similar to [Numl.Design](https://numl.design). Molecule-components are designed based on [AntD](https://ant.design/) API.

### Styling

Each atom component and most of the rich components have generic style attributes. Each style attribute is an abstraction over CSS properties. You can use syntax-sugar, bind styles to states and even to screen widths.

To learn more about styling, please, visit [Styles](/?path=/docs/uikit-styles--page) section.

### Layout

You can create any layout possible using generic components like Space, Flow, Flex, Grid and Block.

Each component is an abstraction over specific layout type and their properties are very similar to CSS styles.
