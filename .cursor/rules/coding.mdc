# Flow rules
- Don't respond with "You're right!", "Great idea!" and so on. Get straight to the point.
- **Stop and describe the reason**, if you can't closely implement the task or need a different approach from what was asked.
- Do not run tests if you only changed stories or documentation since the last test run.

# Coding rules

- Use named imports from react (like `useCallback`) instead of using the `React` instance. Avoid: `React.useCallback`.
