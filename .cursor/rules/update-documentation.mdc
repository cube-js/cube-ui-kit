description: When updating the component documentation file *.docs.mdx
alwaysApply: false

While update {ComponentName}.docs.mdx file look for:
- Implementation - {ComponentName}.tsx
- Tests - {ComponentName}.test.tsx
- Storybook - {ComponentName}.stories.tsx

Align the documentation with the current implementation. Looks for use cases in storybook and code examples in tests.

Don't include ALL stories to documentation. Only those that are make sense to document. Because some stories were only made to test visuals, or basic interactions. Virtualization is a key performance feature, but since it's enabled by default it shouldn't be included as a story to the documentation.

Use links in the following format:

```
- [FilterListBox](/docs/forms-filterlistbox--docs)
```

Where `/docs/` is the standard prefix, `forms` is the section, `filterlistbox` - the low-cased name of the component, `--docs` the standard suffix.
