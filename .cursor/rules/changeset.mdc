Place the changeset to `/.changeset` folder.
Use `patch` version for small fixed (even with breaking changes if they are minor). Use `minor` version for bigger features and noticeable breaking changes.
Use diff of the working tree to analyze changes. If it's empty then use the diff with the `main` branch.
Try to make the changeset concise.
